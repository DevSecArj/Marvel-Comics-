After being exposed to cosmic rays, Reed Richards, Susan Storm, Ben 
Grimm and Johnny Storm found they had amazing new powers. Reed Richards 
found he has the ability to stretch his body in any way he wanted, while 
Susan Storm can turn herself, objects and other people invisible. Ben 
Grimm transformed into a rocky, super-strong behemoth and Johnny Storm 
has the ability to set himself on fire. Dubbed the Fantastic Four, Mr. 
Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Thing and the Human Torch are Marvel's First 
Family.
