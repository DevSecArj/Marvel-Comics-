<pre>

Feared and hated by humans because they're different, the X-Men are 
heroic mutants, individuals born with special powers who've sworn to use 
their gifts to protect mutants as well as humans.

Under a cloud of increasing anti-mutant sentiment, Professor Xavier 
created a safe haven at his Westchester mansion where he could train 
young mutants to use their powers for the betterment of mankind. Aided 
by F.B.I. agent Fred Duncan, Xavier spent months recruiting his early 
students (code-named Cyclops, Iceman, Angel, Beast and Marvel Girl), 
dubbing them "X-Men" because each possessed an "extra" ability normal 
humans lacked. The X-Men made their public debut by thwarting Magneto's 
seizure of the Cape Citadel missile base. The U.S. military was 
grateful, and the youngsters were initially regarded as heroes. Magneto 
would battle the X-Men repeatedly over the years, sometimes leading his 
Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. The X-Men also battled such threats as the 
immovable Blob, the untouchable Unus, the alien Lucifer, the savage 
Swamp Men, the enigmatic Stranger, the unstoppable Juggernaut, and the 
giant mutant-hunting Sentinel robots.
