Born with super-human senses and the power to heal from almost any 
wound, Wolverine was captured by a secret Canadian organization and 
given an unbreakable skeleton and claws. Treated like an animal, it took 
years for him to control himself. Now, he's a premiere member of both 
the X-Men and the Avengers.

CHARACTER INFO

Real Name: James Howlett
Height: 6'3"
Weight: (Without Adamantium skeleton) 195 lbs., (with Adamantium 
skeleton) 300 lbs.
Powers: Wolverine is a mutant who possesses the ability to regenerate 
damaged or destroyed areas of his cellular structure at a rate far 
greater than that of an ordinary human. The speed at which this healing 
factor works varies in direct proportion with the severity of the damage 
Wolverine suffers. For example, he can fully recover from an ordinary 
gunshot wound in a non-vital area of his body within minutes, but it 
took him almost two months to fully recover from injuries sustained in a 
duel with Lord Shingen, which included one from a sword that went all 
the way through his trunk.Wolverine’s natural healing also affords him 
virtual immunity to poisons and most drugs, as well as an enhanced 
resistance to diseases. For example, it is nearly impossible for him to 
become intoxicated from drinking alcohol. He also has a limited immunity 
to the fatigue poisons generated by bodily activity, and hence he has 
greater endurance than an ordinary human. His agility and reflexes are 
similarly enhanced.In addition, Wolverine’s healing factor provides him 
with an extended lifespan by slowing the effects of the aging process. 
Although over a century old, Wolverine is as healthy and physically fit 
as a man in his prime.
