Powers: The Hulk possesses an incredible level of superhuman physical 
ability. His capacity for physical strength is potentially limitless due 
to the fact that the Hulk's strength increases proportionally with his 
level of great emotional stress, anger in particular. The Hulk uses his 
superhumanly strong leg muscles to leap great distances. The Hulk has 
been known to cover hundreds of miles in a single bound and once leaped 
almost into orbit around the Earth. The Hulk can also use his 
superhumanly leg muscles to run at super speeds, although his legs have 
limitless strength he does not have limitless speed and once he reaches 
a certain speed his legs become too strong and destroy the ground giving 
him no friction to run on, therefore he jumps to travel. The Hulk can 
slam his hands together creating a shock wave, this shock wave can 
deafen people, send objects flying and extinguish fires. His thunderclap 
has been compared to hurricanes and sonic booms. The Hulk has shown a 
high resistance to physical damage nearly regardless of the cause, and 
has also shown resistance to extreme temperatures, mind control, nuclear 
explosions, poisons, and all diseases. In addition to the regeneration 
of limbs, vital organs, and damaged or destroyed areas of tissue at an 
amazing rate. The Hulk also has superhuman endurance.The Hulk's body 
also has a gland that makes an "oxygenated per fluorocarbon emulsion", 
which creates pressure in the Hulk's lungs and effectively lets him 
breathe underwater and move quickly between varying depths without 
concerns about decompression or nitrogen narcosis. 

Abilities: Dr. Bruce Banner is a genius in nuclear physics, possessing a 
mind so brilliant that it cannot be measured on any known intelligence 
test. When Banner is the Hulk, Banner's consciousness is buried within 
the Hulk's, and can influence the Hulk's behavior only to a very limited 
extent.
