CHARACTER INFO

Real Name: Steven "Steve" Rogers
Height: 6'2"
Weight: 220 lbs
Powers: Captain America represented the pinnacle of human physical 
perfection. He experienced a time when he was augmented to superhuman 
levels, but generally performed just below superhuman levels for most of 
his career. Captain America had a very high intelligence as well as 
agility, strength, speed, endurance, and reaction time superior to any 
Olympic athlete who ever competed. The Super-Soldier formula that he had 
metabolized had enhanced all of his bodily functions to the peak of 
human efficiency. Most notably, his body eliminates the excessive 
build-up of fatigue-producing poisons in his muscles, granting him 
phenomenal endurance.
