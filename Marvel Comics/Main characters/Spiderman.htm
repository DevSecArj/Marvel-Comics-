CHARACTER INFO<br>

<pre>
Real Name: Peter Benjamin Parker
Height: 5'10"
Weight: 167 lbs.
Powers: Peter can cling to most surfaces, has superhuman strength<br>(able to lift 10 tons optimally) and is roughly 15 times more agile <br>than a regular human. The combination of his acrobatic leaps <br>and web-slinging enables him to travel rapidly from place to place. <br>His spider-sense provides an early warning detection system linked <br>with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabling him the ability to evade <br>most any injury, provided he doesn't cognitively override the <br>autonomic reflexes. Note: his power enhancements through his <br>transformation by the Queen and after battling Morlun - including <br>his organic web glands and stingers - have been undone after <br>Spider-Man's deal with Mephisto. less<br>
Abilities: Peter is an accomplished scientist, inventor and photographer.<br>
Group Affililations : Avengers, formerly the Secret Defenders, "New <br>Fantastic Four", the Outlaws
First Appearance: Amazing Fantasy #15 (1962)<br>
