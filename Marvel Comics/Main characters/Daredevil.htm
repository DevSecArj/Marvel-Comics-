Abandoned by his mother, Matt Murdock was raised by his father, boxer
"Battling Jack" Murdock, in Hell's Kitchen. Realizing that rules were

CHARACTER INFO

Real Name: Matthew Michael Murdock
Height: 6'0"
Weight: 200 lbs.
Powers: In compensation for his lost sight, Daredevil’s other four 
senses have been preternaturally enhanced.His sense of touch is 
sensitive enough to detect the faint impressions of ink on paper, 
allowing him to read by touch. He is also able to feel minute changes in 
temperature and pressure, enough to sense a human body at a distance of 
five feet, due to body heat and air disturbance. His sensitivity to heat 
allows him to sense the temperature of people and objects in order to 
determine whether a person is alive, how long they have been dead if 
they are not, and other changes in body temperature such as blushing or 
the heating up associated with various emotional states, as well as 
residual body heat on an object, or how recently a machine has been in use.
