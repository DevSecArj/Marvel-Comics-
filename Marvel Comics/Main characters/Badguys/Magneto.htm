Magneto was born Max Eisenhardt sometime in the late 1920s to a middle-
class German-Jewish family. Max's father, Jakob Eisenhardt, was a 
decorated World War I veteran.[1] Surviving discrimination and hardship 
during the Nazi rise to power, the passing of the Nuremberg Laws in 
1935, and the Kristallnacht, Max and his family fled to Poland where 
they were captured during the German invasion of Poland and sent to the 
Warsaw Ghetto.

CHARACTER INFO

Real Name: Max Eisenhardt
Height: 6’ 2”
Weight: 190 lbs.
Powers: Magneto possesses the power to control all forms of magnetism. 
He can shape and manipulate magnetic fields that exist naturally or 
artificially. It is unclear, however, whether he must draw magnetic 
force from outside himself (if so, then he can do so over vast 
distances), or whether he can also generate magnetic force from within 
himself. Nor is it clear whether Magneto's power is psionic or purely 
physiological in nature. Magneto's power is, for all practical purposes, 
limitless. Moreover, he can use his magnetic powers in more than one way 
simultaneously. He can completely assemble a complicated machine within 
seconds through his powers. He can erect magnetic force fields with a 
high degree of impenetrability around himself for protection. Although 
Magneto’s primary power is control over magnetism, he can also project 
or manipulate any form of energy that is part of the electromagnetic 
spectrum, including visible light, radio waves, ultraviolet light, gamma 
rays, and x-rays. However, Magneto almost always uses only magnetism, 
since it’s more difficult for him to manipulate other forms of energy. 
Magneto has also exhibited powers of astral projection and telepathy, 
and has claimed to be able to control the minds of others, though his 
abilities along these lines appear to be minimal. Magneto’s ability to 
wield his superhuman powers effectively is dependent upon his physical 
condition. When severely injured, his body is unable to withstand the 
strain of manipulating great amounts of magnetic forces. 

Abilities: Magneto has mastered many technological fields and is a 
scientific genius. He is an expert on genetic engineering and 
manipulation, with knowledge far beyond that of contemporary science. He 
can mutate humans in order to give them superhuman powers, or create 
adult clones of human beings and then manipulate the genetic structures 
of these clones during their development. He has also learned how to 
create artificial living beings. His discoveries in particle physics 
would revolutionize the field and place him among the giants of 
scientific history if they were to be revealed. Magneto is an excellent 
strategist, both in actual battles and games of chess.
