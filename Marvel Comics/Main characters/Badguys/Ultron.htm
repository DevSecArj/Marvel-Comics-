Arguably the greatest and certainly the most horrific creation of 
scientific genius Dr. Henry Pym, Ultron is a criminally insane rogue 
sentient robot dedicated to conquest and the extermination of humanity.

CHARACTER INFO

Real Name: Ultron
Height: 6'9" (variable)
Weight: 735 lbs. (variable)
Powers: Ultron's abilities vary with each redesign, but typically 
include superhuman strength and durability, the power of flight, and 
various offensive weapons such as concussion blasters, radiation 
emitters and his "encephalo-ray", which plunges its victims into a 
deathlike coma. The latter ray also allows Ultron to mesmerize and 
outright mind-control his victims, or implant subliminal hypnotic 
commands within their minds to be enacted at a later time. Ultron's 
outer shell is usually composed of Adamantium, rendering it almost 
totally impervious to damage; however, his internal mechanisms are 
generally less durable and more easily damaged. Ultron's Adamantium 
forms have proven vulnerable to molecular rearrangement devices and the 
metal-destabilizing ore known as Savage Land Glossary:V#Vibranium, 
Vibranium ("anti-metal"). Some Ultron models feature tractor beams and 
energy absorption capabilities. Most Ultrons are powered by a small 
internal nuclear furnace, and incorporate a "program transmitter" which 
can beam part or all of Ultron's programming into remote locations such 
as computers or alternate robotic bodies. Ultron can often control other 
machines remotely even if he has not transplanted his consciousness into 
them. One recent Ultron model developed hive-mind technology, allowing 
him to animate and control hundreds of alternate Ultron bodies at the 
same time, becoming a robotic one-man army. Ultron is one of the 
foremost robotics experts on Earth.
