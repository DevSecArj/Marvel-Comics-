The third season for “Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD” has recently debuted and to capitalize on the momentum, developer Netmarble has announced that nine of the characters from the show will be coming to “Marvel: Future Fight”. This is the first ever collaboration between Marvel’s television and video game divisions, since previous new characters were introduced to promote new movies or comic books.

New playable characters include Phil Coulson, Daisy Johnson in her new “Quake” attire, Deathlok, Melinda May, Bobbi Morse, Lincoln Campbell and Asgardian warrior Sif. The two other characters -- Raina and Gordon -- will be bosses in the game, according to a report from Variety.

Including Bobbi Morse in the game is a bit of an odd choice, since her super hero counterpart Mockingbird is already in the game. It’s unsure if Morse will be using the codename in “Agents of SHIELD” anytime soon, especially since her backstory in the show has major variations from her comic book roots. Her romance with Hawkeye for example, has been completely scrapped from the cinematic universe.

Future storylines in the game might also be influenced from the show according to Comic Book. The game had previously streamlined stories from the Marvel movies and comics, like “Ant-Man” and “Avengers: Age of Ultron”.

“Marvel’s Agents of SHIELD” has been picking up a lot of momentum lately, with the reveal of Daisy Johnson’s powers and the recent focus on the “Inhumans”. There has been a big push for the Inhumans in the comic books of late, and a movie about the characters has already been announced as part of Marvel’s “Phase 3” plans.

Currently, “Marvel: Future Fight” boasts over 50 characters from Marvel comics and the cinematic universe, including fan favorites like "Spider-Man," "The Avengers" and "The Guardians of the Galaxy." Notable exceptions are characters from the "X-Men" and "Fantastic Four," since Fox currently owns the movie rights of both franchises.

The “Agents of SHIELD” will be available on Oct. 7. Fans interested in “Marvel: Future Fight” can download the mobile game for free on iOS and Android.
