Abilities: Captain America had mastered the martial arts of American-
style boxing and judo, and had combined these disciplines with his own 
unique hand-to-hand style of combat. He had also shown skill and 
knowledge of a number of other martial arts. He engaged in a daily 
regimen of rigorous exercise (including aerobics, weight lifting, 
gymnastics, and simulated combat) to keep himself in peak condition. 
Captain America was one of the finest human combatants Earth had ever 
known.
