Wolverine also possesses superhumanly acute 
senses, making him capable of seeing things at a maximum distance 
greater than a normal human’s. His hearing is enhanced in a similar 
manner, and he is able to recognize people and objects by scent, even if 
that person or object is hidden. Wolverine can use these enhanced senses 
to track any creature with an impressive degree of success.Wolverine’s 
skeleton includes six retractable one-foot long bone claws, three in 
each arm, that are housed beneath the skin and muscle of his forearms. 
Wolverine can, at will, release these slightly curved claws through his 
skin beneath the knuckles on each hand. The skin between the knuckles 
tears and bleeds, but the blood loss is quickly halted by his healing 
factor. Wolverine can unsheathe any number of his claws at once, 
although he must keep his wrists straight at the moment his claws shoot 
from his forearms into his hands. When unsheathed, the claws are fully 
within his hands, and thus Wolverine can still bend his wrists. The 
claws are naturally sharp and tougher than that of normal human bone 
structure, allowing Wolverine to cut through most types of flesh and 
natural materials.Despite the extent of his healing factor, Wolverine is 
not immortal. If the injuries are extensive enough, especially if they 
result in the loss of vital organs, large amounts of blood, and/or loss 
of physical form, such as having flesh burned away by fire or acid, 
Wolverine can die.


Abilities: Due to his extensive training as a soldier, a C.I.A. 
operative, a samurai, a spy, and a member of the X-Men, Wolverine is an 
exceptional hand-to-hand combatant, having mastered virtually every 
fighting style on Earth. He is also a trained expert in multiple types 
of weapons, vehicles, computer systems, explosives, and assassination 
techniques. Wolverine is fluent in many languages, including Japanese, 
Russian, Chinese, Cheyenne, Lakota, and Spanish; he has some knowledge 
of French, Thai, and Vietnamese.
