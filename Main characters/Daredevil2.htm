Daredevil’s sense of smell is enhanced enough to distinguish 
individuals by their natural odors, and remember and identify them no 
matter how they attempt to mask their scent, as well as track that 
individual scent through a crowd of people at a distance of roughly 50 
feet.His sense of taste is sharp enough to enable him to detect the 
number of grains of salt on a pretzel. His ability to remember tastes 
enables him to determine every ingredient of a food or drink he tastes, 
as long as there are at least 20 milligrams of that substance 
present.Daredevil’s enhanced sense of hearing enables him to detect an 
acoustic pressure change of 1 decibel at a pressure level of 7, whereas 
the average human can only detect a sound as low as 20 decibels. He can 
even hear people speaking through a standard soundproofed wall. 
Daredevil is also able to hear a heartbeat from 20 feet away, as well as 
identify people by their individual beat rhythm, or detect whether they 
are lying or not by the changes in their heartbeat, though a pace maker 
or self control will confuse his reading. Not only does Daredevil’s 
hearing allow him to be constantly aware of his own heartbeat, blood 
circulation, breathing, physical movements, etc, but he is also able to 
hear and sense the same attributes in other people. One of the primary 
ways he does this is by hearing the reverberations made by ambient 
sounds on objects and people, giving him a sonar-like sense of where 
things are, and how dense they are. And while he is able to block out a 
good amount of background noise, he can also be excessively disoriented 
by unexpected loud noises and can be confused when immersed in the wash 
of sound from a busy crowd.Along with the enhancement of Daredevil’s 
normal senses, he has gained another sense which he calls his Radar 
Sense. According to one theory, this sense reacts to an emission of 
electromagnetic energy a mutation in his brain has caused, reading the 
reverberations of this energy as a 360º, 3-D map of objects. This 
“sight” is not perfect, and can only give Daredevil an impression of the 
exact physical shape of objects, not a literal one. Closely overlapping 
objects can also confuse this sense.The mutations that have heightened 
Daredevil’s level of sensitivity have also increased his awareness of 
other forms of electromagnetic radiation. He is capable of detecting and 
identifying any electromagnetic radiation on the standard scale; from 
radio waves, (which he can only detect, not understand the message) all 
the way to gamma waves, and everything in between. He is also able to 
judge the strength of a given radiation and even differentiate between 
individual colors by the amount of radiation they give off. At very 
close range, Daredevil is able to detect the micro voltage of a human 
being’s brain.
 
Abilities: Daredevil possesses the strength, speed, agility, and 
endurance, not to mention acrobatic and gymnastic skills, of an 
Olympic-level athlete. Through a combination of the tutelage of Stick 
and self-training, Daredevil is a master of a unique martial art form, 
which is a hybridized form of American boxing and the Japanese arts of 
ninjutsu, judo and aiki-jujutsu. Martial arts training has given him an 
immense degree of concentration and personal control over his body and 
energy, or Ki. Daredevil is also an accomplished criminal trial lawyer.
