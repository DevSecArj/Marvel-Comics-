Little is known about Mystique's past due to the fact that she can 
eliminate the outward signs of aging with her shape-changing power, and 
it's not known exactly how old she is. She apparently learned to use her 
shape-changing power at a very early age, for there is no evidence known 
to the public or the government that Raven Darkholme ever looked like 
anything but a normal human being.
